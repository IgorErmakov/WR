# WR
That's a test application. It gets the weather for entered city. 
It uses an external service and does the concurrent HTTP calls.

DB is needed. I use the table 'cities' which contains coordinates. It's quite big, so I don't use a laravel seeder.
So, please import `/database/sql_dump/wr-18-02-2019.sql.gz` if needed.
